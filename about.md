# About me

Hi there! I'm Rick.

I'm a human (not a robot, thanks for noticing!) who likes to build and learn. I mainly build things out of 1s and 0s. But I learn all sorts of things. For the past few years I've mostly been diving deeper and deeper into computer science. 

I'm a trained economist, but I've come to appreciate that computer scientists think surprisingly clearly about economic issues--what with their concern for information processing and Big O considerations. My basic economic interests center around the idea of emergent order and "Market Process Economics". These concepts don't lend themselves to the standard equation-based modeling of mainstream economics, but they do lend themselves to Agent Based Modeling. 

A really cool example of a project in this vein is Robert Axelrod's *Evolution of Cooperation* project. My own small contribution to that project is a [model](https://github.com/RickWeber/Prisoners_Dilemma_ABM) I built in NetLogo.
